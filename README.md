## 💡 Pain Points & Solutions

### For Traders & Investors
**Pain Point:** Traders risk massive financial losses by acting on viral market rumors, fake earnings reports, or manipulated stock news that can crash portfolios in minutes.

**Genesis Solution:** Our Corporate Intelligence Engine provides real-time news verification with a Reliability Score, sentiment analysis, and temporal tracking. Traders get a "market truth dashboard" showing verified vs. fake news ratios, preventing costly decisions based on misinformation.

### For Journalists & Newsrooms
**Pain Point:** Journalists face intense deadline pressure to publish accurate stories, but verifying claims across multiple sources takes hours, risking the spread of unverified information.

**Genesis Solution:** The Main Agent routes queries instantly to specialized verifiers. Journalists can upload audio interviews for transcription and fact-checking, or scan crisis trends proactively. Our synthesis agent creates professional, sourced responses in seconds.

### For YouTubers & Content Creators
**Pain Point:** Content creators risk platform strikes, demonetization, or legal issues from sharing unverified claims, manipulated images, or trending but false narratives in their videos.

**Genesis Solution:** Visual claim extraction from screenshots prevents sharing fake tweet graphics. The Chrome extension allows right-click verification of scripts or articles. Voice mode enables real-time brainstorming with built-in fact-checking.

### For Researchers & Academics
**Pain Point:** Researchers need deep, structured analysis with citations, not just "True/False" labels. Generic tools lack the depth and source grounding required for academic work.

**Genesis Solution:** Confidence scoring (0.0-1.0), bias assessment, and comprehensive source grounding provide academic-grade verification. The synthesis agent structures findings into professional reports with evidence paragraphs.

## 🔄 How It Works: Complete Agent Flows & Explanations

Genesis employs a sophisticated agent orchestration system, inspired by real A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication protocols. Here's the complete breakdown of how our specialized agents collaborate across all use cases:

### 1. Main Agent → Check Agent Flow (Core Fact-Checking Pipeline)
```
User Query → Main Agent (Intelligent Routing) → Check Agent (Multi-Source Verification) → Synthesis Agent (Professional Response)
```

**Detailed Process:**
- **Main Agent Analysis**: Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash to understand query intent, determines if fact-checking is needed
- **Check Agent Execution**: Performs Google Search with grounding, analyzes 5+ sources, calculates confidence scores (0.0-1.0)
- **Synthesis Agent**: Structures response with verdict emojis, evidence paragraphs, and source citations
- **Example**: "Is 5G linked to COVID-19?" → VERDICT: FAKE, CONFIDENCE: 0.95 → Professional explanation with WHO sources

**Use Cases**: Journalists verifying claims, Traders checking market rumors, Researchers validating data

### 2. Main Agent → Scan Crisis Flow (Proactive Misinformation Detection)
```
User/Crisis Trigger → Main Agent → Scan Crisis Action → Batch Check Agent Calls → Trend Analysis → Dashboard Report
```

**Detailed Process:**
- **Crisis Detection**: Monitors trending topics using Google Search trends
- **Automated Scanning**: Finds top 3-5 viral claims per crisis
- **Parallel Verification**: Check Agent processes multiple claims simultaneously
- **Trend Analytics**: Aggregates severity levels, volume metrics, and emerging patterns
- **Example**: Ukraine conflict → Scans for "Russia won Kyiv", "Peace treaty signed" → Real-time dashboard with verified corrections

**Use Cases**: Breaking news monitoring, Crisis response teams, Content moderation

### 3. Main Agent → Process Image Flow (Visual Content Verification)
```
Image Upload → Main Agent → Image Agent (OCR + Extraction) → Check Agent (Claim Verification) → Verified Output
```

**Detailed Process:**
- **Image Agent**: Uses Gemini Vision to extract text, claims, and context from images/screenshots
- **Claim Isolation**: Identifies specific factual claims (headlines, social posts, charts)
- **Cross-Verification**: Check Agent validates against real data sources
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains original image context in verification results
- **Example**: Viral tweet screenshot → Extracts "Stock crashed 50%" → Verifies against NYSE data → "FAKE: Actually +0.3%"

**Use Cases**: Social media verification, News screenshot checking, Visual misinformation detection

### 4. Voice Interaction Flow (Real-Time Conversational Verification)
```
User Speech → Transcriber Agent → Live Gemini Session → Tool Calls → Check Agent → Voice Response Synthesis
```

**Detailed Process:**
- **Audio Transcription**: Real-time speech-to-text with WebRTC
- **Live AI Session**: Gemini 2.5 Flash maintains conversation context
- **Dynamic Tool Calling**: Automatically invokes verification when factual questions detected
- **Voice Response**: Synthesized audio responses with natural conversation flow
- **Example**: "Does electric vehicle production hurt the environment?" → Live verification → Voice explanation with EPA data

**Use Cases**: Podcasting, Interviews, Accessibility for visually impaired users

### 5. Company Intelligence Flow (Enterprise Analysis Pipeline)
```
Company Registration → Agent 1 (Web Discovery) → Agent 2 (News Aggregation) → Agent 3 (Verification) → Dashboard Storage → Conversational Interface
```

**Detailed Process:**
- **Agent 1**: Searches for official websites, social media, investor relations
- **Agent 2**: Executes 5 targeted searches for 30 news items across categories
- **Agent 3**: Cross-references each news item with official sources, assigns bias/impact scores
- **Temporal Storage**: MongoDB graph database with timestamped relationships
- **Query Interface**: Natural language queries like "Show negative news from last week"

**Use Cases**: Corporate reputation monitoring, Investor due diligence, Brand protection

### 6. Data Query Flow (Conversational Analytics)
```
User Question → Query Routing Agent → Database Retrieval → AI Analysis Agent → Natural Language Response
```

**Detailed Process:**
- **Intent Classification**: Determines query type (statistics, sources, timeline, etc.)
- **Smart Filtering**: Applies date ranges, verdict filters, category filters
- **AI Synthesis**: Transforms raw data into conversational insights
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains data relationships and temporal context
- **Example**: "How has our reliability score changed?" → Analyzes trend data → "Improved 15% this month due to fewer fake news items"

**Use Cases**: Executive reporting, Stakeholder communication, Data-driven decision making

### System Architecture Benefits
- **Scalability**: Agents can process hundreds of queries simultaneously
- **Accuracy**: Multi-source verification with confidence scoring
- **Speed**: Sub-second responses for most queries
- **Reliability**: Fallback mechanisms and error recovery
- **Extensibility**: New agents can be added for specialized verification tasks

## 🏢 Company Intelligence Dashboard

### Registration & Profile Creation
Companies register via secure API endpoints, creating profiles with basic info (name, industry, website).

### Agent 1: Web Presence Discovery
```
Company Name from DB → Agent 1 → Google Search → Official Websites + Social Media + Investor Relations
```

**Example:** For "Tesla Inc."
- Finds official website: tesla.com
- Social: twitter.com/tesla, linkedin.com/company/tesla
- Investor: ir.tesla.com

### Agent 2: Multi-Source News Aggregation
```
Company Name → Agent 2 → 5 Targeted Google Searches → 30 News Items (Financial, Product, Legal, etc.)
```

**Categories:** Breaking News (12), Financial (10), Product/Innovation (8), Partnerships (6), Legal/Regulatory (4)

### Agent 3: Cross-Reference Verification
```
News Items + Official Sources → Agent 3 → Verification Engine → VERDICT + Confidence + Bias + Impact
```

**Enhanced Analysis:** Each news item gets bias assessment, impact rating, and detailed reasoning.

### Temporal Graph Storage
